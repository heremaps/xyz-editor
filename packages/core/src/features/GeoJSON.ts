     *  A geometry is a object where the type member's value is one of: "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon" or "MultiPolygon".
     *  A geometry object must have a member with the name "coordinates".
     *  The value of the coordinates member is always an array (referred to as the coordinates array below).
     *  The structure for the elements in this array are determined by the type of geometry.
     *
     *  For type "Point", each element in the coordinates array is a number representing the point coordinate in one dimension.
     *      There must be at least two elements, and may be more.
     *      The order of elements must follow x, y, z order (or longitude, latitude, altitude for coordinates in a geographic coordinate reference system).
     *
     *  For type "MultiPoint", each element in the coordinates array is a coordinates array as described for type "Point".
     *
     *  For type "LineString", each element in the coordinates array is a coordinates array as described for type "Point".
     *      The coordinates array for a LineString must have two or more elements.
     *      A LinearRing is a special case of type LineString where the first and last elements in the coordinates array are equivalent (they represent equivalent points).
     *      Though a LinearRing is not explicitly represented as a geometry type, it is referred to in the Polygon geometry type definition.
     *
     *  For type "MultiLineString", each element in the coordinates array is a coordinates array as described for type "LineString".
     *
     *  For type "Polygon", each element in the coordinates array is a coordinates array as described for type "LineString".
     *      Furthermore, each LineString in the coordinates array must be a LinearRing.
     *      For Polygons with multiple LinearRings, the first must be the exterior ring and any others must be interior rings or holes.
     *
     *  For type "MultiPolygon", each element in the coordinates array is a coordinates array as described for type "Polygon".
