/**
 * Style object represents supported style attributes of Features. It indicates how a symbolizer in feature should be rendered.
 *
 * A style object should always include "zIndex" and "type" attributes, and each type of symbolizer should include its own type-specific attributes:
 * - Circle: "radius" must be included and either "fill" or "stroke" should be included.
 * - Rect: "width" must be included and "height" will be set with the same value as "width" if only "width" is present. Either "fill" or "stroke" should be included
 * - Text: "text" or "textRef" should be included and "fill" or "stroke" should also be included for text color
 * - Image: "src" and "width" must be included. "height" will be set with the same value as "width" if only "width" is present.
 * - Line: "stroke" must be included.
 * - Polygon: "fill" or "stroke" must be included.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * // example of Circle:
 * {zIndex:0, type:"Circle", radius:16, fill:"#FFFF00"}
 *
 * // example of Rect:
 * {zIndex:0, type:"Rect", fill:"#4C9EEF", stroke:"#0156BB", width:20, height:20}
 *
 * // example of Text:
 * {zIndex:1, type:"Text", fill:"#FFFFFF", text:"HERE", font:"normal 12px Arial"}
 *
 * // example of Image:
 * {zIndex:0, type:"Image", src:"./here.png", width:20, height:20}
 *
 * // example of Line:
 * {zIndex:0, type:"Line", opacity:0.5, stroke:"#BE6B65", strokeLinecap:"round", strokeLinejoin:"round", strokeWidth:16}
 *
 * // example of Polygon:
 * {zIndex:0, type:"Polygon", opacity:0.5, stroke:"#BE6B65", fill:"#FFFFFF"}
