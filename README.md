## Setup your XYZ token

Setup an XYZ token is only required if the XYZ Hub endpoint at xyz.api.here.com is used.
You can get a token by following the instructions in this [guide](https://www.here.xyz/api/getting-token/).

If you are using a [local XYZ Hub](https://github.com/heremaps/xyz-hub#getting-started) simply set `set-access-token` to an empty string.

Running integration tests / playground and debug pages requires the XYZ token to be provided.

* Configure your XYZ token
    ```
    yarn run set-access-token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

## Serve debug page

* Start debug server (requires xyz access token)
    ```
    yarn run server
    ```
    browser will start and open http://localhost:8080/debug automatically



## Serve Playground

* Build and start the playground (requires xyz access token)
    ```
    yarn run playground
    ```
    browser will start and open http://localhost:8081/packages/playground/dist automatically
